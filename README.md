# AirBnB clone - The console
The goal of the project is to deploy on a server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
It won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

# First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This first step is very important because it will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end in

# What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

# Execution
Your could work like this in interactive mode:

	$ ./console.py
	(hbnb) help

	Documented commands (type help <topic>):
	========================================
	EOF  help  quit

	(hbnb) 
	(hbnb) 
	(hbnb) quit
	$

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

	$ echo "help" | ./console.py
	(hbnb)

	Documented commands (type help <topic>):
	========================================
	EOF  help  quit
	(hbnb) 
	$
	$ cat test_help
	help
	$
	$ cat test_help | ./console.py
	(hbnb)

	Documented commands (type help <topic>):
	========================================
	EOF  help  quit
	(hbnb) 
	$

# Commands:
* create - create an object
* show - show an object (based on id)
* destroy - destroy an object
* all - show all objects, of one type or all types
* update - Updates an instance based on the class name and id
* quit/EOF - quit the console
* help - see descriptions of commands
